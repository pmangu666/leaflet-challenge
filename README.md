# leaflet-challenge
Overview
This project involves creating an interactive map using Leaflet.js, displaying various datasets such as earthquake data and tectonic plate boundaries. The project is divided into two parts:

Part 1: Basic setup and displaying earthquake data.

Part 2: Enhancing the map with additional layers and interactivity.

Features
Part 1
Interactive Map: Initialize a Leaflet map centered on a specific location.

Earthquake Data: Fetch and display recent earthquake data using GeoJSON from the USGS API.

Dynamic Markers: Markers with dynamic sizes and colors based on earthquake magnitude and depth.

Popups: Detailed information about each earthquake displayed in popups.
Part 2
Multiple Base Maps: Integration of various base maps (Street Map, Topographic Map, OSM Hot, CartoDB Dark Matter).

Additional Layers: Tectonic plates boundaries layer.

Layer Controls: Toggle visibility of different layers and switch between base maps.

Legend: Custom legend for depth of earthquakes.

Technologies
Leaflet.js: An open-source JavaScript library for interactive maps.

JavaScript (ES6): Core scripting language for the project.

HTML5 & CSS3: Structure and styling of the web page.

GeoJSON: Format for encoding a variety of geographic data structures.
